# Design Doc for Weed Strike

### Goals

_____ is a fairly standard, simple roguelike. As such, the player gets
* character advancement/progression (on the mechanics side of things, not necessarily the story side)
  * some opponents that are too challenging to fight in the early stages of the game are easy to beat by the later stages of the game
* inventory management
* primary mob interactions are combat ('attack it' is never a bad choice from a story standpoint)
  * some tactically interesting combat
    * at the very least, players must make decisions about whether to fight or flee a given opponent
* exploration (of procedurally generated content)
* a simple framing story to engage the player and justify the avatar actions, but nothing to deep and little in the way of narrative progression
* a final battle/goal
* other standard roguelike experiences (permadeath, turn-based action, etc.)

### Story

You find yourself in the top of a tower, and you need to get down. The tower is standing in an abyss, you can't see ground out the window. The tower is perilous and it appears easy to fall off the sides or through the floor.
You see very powerful monsters outside the tower in the distance and hear more on the floors below you. You need to make your way down the tower safely, combating the monsters you come across. Hopefully there is a way to escape at the bottom.
